## 🎮 About

BURGIRL is a classic arcade-style shoot 'em up game built with SDL3. You know, one of those games where vegetables are somehow the bad guys. 
Battle through waves of vegetable enemies across two levels while dodging their attacks and trying not to lose all your health.
It's ironic, isn't it?
Because apparently, tomatoes, broccoli, and carrots have declared war on burgers, and it's your job to stop them.
